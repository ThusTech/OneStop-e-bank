## What:
The problem is the lack of full accessibility in e-banking services for blind and visually impaired individuals. Many financial platforms, including websites, mobile apps, and ATMs, do not adequately support tools like screen readers or voice-activated services. This results in these individuals facing significant barriers to managing their finances independently​(

## Where:
The problem is prevalent across many regions, but in the context of South Africa, it is particularly evident in major banks such as FNB, Absa, and Standard Bank, where accessibility shortcomings have been highlighted. Other emerging banks, like Bank Zero, also struggle with accessibility at launch​(

## Why:
The root cause of this problem is the lack of prioritization of inclusive design in the initial development of digital banking platforms. Financial institutions have often overlooked the importance of creating user-friendly experiences for individuals with disabilities, despite regulations and standards being in place to guide accessibility​(

## How:
The problem manifests through inaccessible user interfaces that are not compatible with assistive technologies such as screen readers, voice commands, or talking ATMs. This forces visually impaired users to either rely on external help, which compromises their privacy and independence, or face significant difficulties in accessing their financial data and services​(

Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive approach, where banks integrate accessibility into their core services, ensuring inclusivity for all users.
